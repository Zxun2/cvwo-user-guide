# Features

Features! Here we are. I wonder what cool things this application holds‚Åâ‚Åâ‚Åâ

## Feature 1: Filter Component

Over time, there may be too many steps to keep track of. Here, we introduce the filter component to save you the trouble of scrolling through the page.

Also note that you can _literally_ search for anything. From steps to tags, the application will find it! No matter!

## Feature 2: Search Functionality

Located at the top right hand corner, you will see a search bar. When you click the search bar, the application will automatically generate a list of current groups. You can click any one of those to navigate to that directory.

![Search bar](../../static/img/docs/Search-bar.png)

Not only that, but you can create groups directly from the search bar. Here's an example:

![Creating a group from the search bar](../../static/img/docs/new-group-from-search.png)

:::info

On enter, a modal will appear, with **synced inputfield**.

![Group modal from search](../../static/img/docs/group-create-modal.png)

Then, the new group will appear on the left sidebar.
