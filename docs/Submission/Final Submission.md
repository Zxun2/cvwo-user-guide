**Thoughts**

I would have laughed at myself if I had told myself before the winter break that I would be designing a Progressive Web Application from scratch. _I had no idea what a PWA was!_ Time and again, I am greeted with a variety of roadblocks and unknown issues. Days and weeks pass with little discernible movement on the situation at hand.

With absolutely no experience in Ruby on Rails, I dedicated the majority of my time during the first month or so familiarizing myself with Ruby syntax and studying the best possible practices for scaling the backend. I read the documentation thoroughly, trying out each and every example myself, and finally, with a plan in place, I began to work on the backend application. The entire process was rather smooth, except for setting up the project as I was a Windows user and have never used Linux in my life. Thankfully, with docker, the entire process of setting up was as easy as just a _single_ command. _Thanks, docker!_

When the backend application is completed, I begin to focus on the Frontend side. Since I had prior web development knowledge, I was rather adept at using Javascript and hence, the choice of using it as the main programming language of choice. The CSS Library I have chosen is Material UI for its simplicity and fast proto-typing with its pre-built components. Material UI is based on the idea of Styled Components, which is something I am very familiar with.

Overall, the entire experience was truly amazing.

**Accomplishments**

- **An understanding of Docker and why it's useful**

  Without Docker, the entire development process for the backend application would have been a nightmare. I had many issues and bugs surfacing that werenâ€™t even listed on StackOverflow. Docker follows closely to the philosophy of _developing once, run anywhere_. With **seamless portability**, this allows applications to run across any desktops, data center, and cloud environment, all _without any modification_.

- **An understanding of the web development cycle**

  More than anything else, I have come to appreciate the software development cycle. With prior experience _in web development in teams_, I am familiar with the various software development models. In this particular assignment, I have chosen to adopt the Waterfall model. The Waterfall Model is particularly useful for this assignment as it is a relatively small project and there are specific deliverables as stated in the assignment requirements. With detailed ideation and design, it can significantly help to reduce development time and make it easy to add new features.

- **Refactoring to TypeScript**

  Despite my familiarity with Javascript, converting the program to Typescript was extremely buggy, and the entire process was fraught with uncertainty - I couldn't be sure I wasn't heading down a rabbit hole, and I was short on time. Despite these difficulties, the switch to Typescript proved to be a pleasant surprise. Several unexpected and minor flaws surfaced during the process, and I discovered how many hidden bugs Typescript alone had managed to disclose. _Definitely adding this one to my future projects!_
