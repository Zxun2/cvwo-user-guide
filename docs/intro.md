# Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Zong xun. I'm a Y1 CS and Statistics undergraduate at NUS. Without further ado, let's begin the user tour!

So....what is _Groups and Steps?_ Groups and Steps üìù is a Progressive Web Application built with Rails and React for CVWO 2021/2022 assignment. It allows you to manage your tasks into groups, and further break them down into steps. Plan, manage and track all your tasks in one _flexible_ software. It will continue grow as you do!

## What do we offer?

1. Create. Read. Delete. Update. These tasks awaits you!
2. Prioritize tasks, set due dates and check statuses with a glance.
3. Application wide notifcation system.
4. Over time, the number of groups may be too much to keep track. That's why we have the search bar (with Autocompletion)!
5. Filter your steps with just a click.
6. A task bar to remind you for your upcoming deadlines
7. ...And More!
